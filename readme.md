# Privacy resources
This is another repository of privacy oriented software, services and others. I want to fill this repository with content suggested by users with minimal intervention from myself. The process of suggesting items for this repository is detailed down.

## Table of contents
- [Privacy resources](#privacy-resources)
  - [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
  - [How to add resources to this list?](#how-to-add-resources-to-this-list)

## How to add resources to this list?
I created the process of submitting resources with the community in mind. The process of adding resources to the list consists of making an issue after a certain template then getting through 4 stages:
- [`stage 0`](https://github.com/koocieyu/privacy-resources/labels/stage%200) where I will be checking if the submission is valid (no spam, valid data in submission)
- [`stage 1`](https://github.com/koocieyu/privacy-resources/labels/stage%201) where I will check for obvious anti-privacy features which anyone interested in the topic would be able to see.
- [`stage 2`](https://github.com/koocieyu/privacy-resources/labels/stage%202) where the community will start debating whether this resource deserves to be added to the list.
- [`stage 3`](https://github.com/koocieyu/privacy-resources/labels/stage%203) where after every doubt about the resource has been cleared and everyone has an opinion about the specific product, a vote will be held. I will be posting a link to a poll where people can vote whether this resource deserves to be added to the list or not. This usually lasts for 2 or more weeks. After this stage there can be 3 possible outcomes:
  - Your suggestion getting approved
  - Your suggestion getting rejected with a possibility of it being accepted after the creator of the initial resource does some changes
  - Your suggestion getting rejected with a high probability of it never being accepted
